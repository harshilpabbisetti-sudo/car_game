for obstacles i made holes in roads and traffic cones with random positioning in a part of the road

for road generation i used a 2d array which can be easily manipulated to change the size of the road and the shape of the map creating infinite posibilities to make a looped road
a seperate loop generation logic can be applied to the same to make the loop truely random
